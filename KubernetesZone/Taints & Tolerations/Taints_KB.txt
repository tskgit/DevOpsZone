1.Create a taint on node01 with key of 'spray', value of 'mortein' and effect of 'NoSchedule'
Key = spray
Value = mortein
Effect = NoSchedule

    # kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule

2.Create another pod named 'bee' with the NGINX image, which has a toleration set to the taint Mortein.

Image name: nginx
Key: spray
Value: mortein
Effect: NoSchedule
Status: Running

  # k run bee --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > bee.yaml
  Edit bee.yaml
  see toleration_bee.yml

3.Remove the taint on master/controlplane, which currently has the taint effect of NoSchedule.

# kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule-

Note: We just need to include '-' at the end to remove the taints.
